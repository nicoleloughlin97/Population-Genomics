# Analysis of Population Genomics with R
### Nicole Loughlin - 14487568

# Background
My name is Nicole Loughlin, and I am currently studying a Masterâ€™s degree in Data and Computational Science with University College Dublin. As part of my studies, I am required to complete 'ACM40960 Projects in Maths Modelling' module. I have chosen to base my project on Population Genomics with R.

# Aim
The aim of this project is to investigate the capabilities of R in analysing various Population Genetic models.

# Data
Data was acquired from NCBI (National Centre for Biotechnology Information) and from data set included in the Bioconductor package, adegenet.

# Getting Started
This project utilises the free open-sourced statistical programming language, R. To recreate this analysis, download R, along with the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) R Studio. After downloading, launch R Studio and install the following packages; ape, adegenet , BiocPkgTools, GenomicRanges, plyranges, pegas. 


# Abstract
This project explores the capabilities of the statistical programming language R in analysing population genomic data. Population Genomics is a topic traditionally studied and explored by biologists and scientists alike. In recent years, collaboration among these experts with data scientists, computer scientists and mathematicians has paved the way for exciting new branches of study and a totally different way of looking at genomic data. This project explores many common theory & methods used in the field, along with case studies on 2 sets of genomic data: Human Genomes and Influenza H1N1 Virus Sequences.
