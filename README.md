# Analyses of Population Genomics with R
### Nicole Loughlin - 14487568

# Background
My name is Nicole Loughlin, and I am currently studying a Master’s degree in Data and Computational Science with University College Dublin. As part of my studies, I am required to complete 'ACM40960 Projects in Maths Modelling' module. I have chosen to base my project on Population Genomics with R.

# Aim
The aim of this project is to investigate the capabilites of R in analysing various Population Genetic models.

# Data
Data was acquired from…

# Getting Started
This project utilises the free open-sourced statistical programming language, R. To recreate this analysis, download R, along with the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) R Studio. After downloading, launch R Studio and install the below packages by running the following code in the console…

# Key Elements
Key findings…

# SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

The following system configuration was used. Note that changes to hardware may affect the model training, project execution time etc.
